### EE551 Final Project Fall 2019
Manish Balakrishnan <br />

### Introduction
Python offers many opportunites for Machine Learning applications. This project explores Python's Machine Learning packages to correctly identify digits from a dataset of thousands of handwritten images of digits. This project will use dtasets from MNIST("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") provided by Kaggle to train and test classification algorithms. A Convolutional Neural Network implemented using Keras The skills learned from this project will be very educational as they are the basis for many computer vision and machine learning fundamentals.

The scope and goals of this project are:
* Code written in Python
* Organized Github repository
* Inclusion of test code
* Reproducibility
* Neural Network Fundamentals
* Additional goals if achievable

The project will be completed by the deadline of 12/02/2019 Monday at 5pm ET

### Image Classification Theory
Image classification is the concept of taking an image and being able to classify it based on the contents of the image. This concept has now been acheivable through the use of Machine Learning. When an image is inputted to a computer, it is read as a bitmap of pixels. With the advent of machine learning, we are able to pass the image into different layers to pick up attributes/uinque features of the image in order to classify it. To acheive this, numerous layers are used, discussed below.  

### Acknowledgements <br />
The project will use datasets obtained from Kaggle and use the Keras library, an open-source neural network library.
