# Exploration Into Machine Learning: Classifying Hand-Drawn Digits
### EE551 Final Project Fall 2019
Manish Balakrishnan <br />

### Introduction
Python offers many . This project explores Python's Machine Learning capabilities and packages to correctly identify digits from a dataset of thousands of handwritten images of digits. This project will use dtasets from MNIST("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") provided by Kaggle to train and test classification algorithms. The skills learned from this project will be very educational as they are the basis for many computer vision and machine learning fundamentals. 

The scope and goals of this project are:
* Code written in Python
* Organized Github repository
* Inclusion of test code
* Reproducibility
* Neural Network Fundamentals
* Additional goals if achievable

The project will be completed by the deadline of 12/02/2019 Monday at 5pm ET

### Acknowledgements <br />
The project will use datasets obtained from Kaggle and use the Keras library, an open-source neural network library.
